# Sales Data Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing sales data to understand product performance, regional trends, and revenue patterns using Python. The goal of the project is to practice data analysis skills and extract meaningful insights from a real-world styled dataset.

# Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sales data
- Analyze sales performance by product and region
- Identify trends in revenue over time
- Visualize insights using charts and graphs
- Understand relationships between numerical features using correlation analysis

# Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Streamlit (optional)

# Analysis Performed

- Calculated total sales using units sold and unit price
- Analyzed total sales by product
- Analyzed total sales by region
- Studied daily sales trends
- Performed correlation analysis on numerical features

# Key Insights

- Total Sales has a strong positive correlation with Units Sold, indicating that higher sales volume significantly increases revenue.
- Unit Price has a moderate impact on Total Sales.
- Certain products and regions consistently perform better than others.
- Sales trends vary over time, showing fluctuations in daily revenue.

# Visualizations

The project includes:
- Bar charts for product-wise and region-wise sales
- Line charts showing sales trends over time
- Correlation heatmap to understand relationships between variables

# How to Run the Project

# Run the Notebook

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

2. Open sales_analysis.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
